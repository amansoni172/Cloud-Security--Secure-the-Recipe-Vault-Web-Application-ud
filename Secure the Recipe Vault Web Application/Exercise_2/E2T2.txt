Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1.) IAM policy is not following the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources.
2.) Loadbalancer is not configured to redirect Non-SSL(HTTP) requests to SSL(HTTPS)
3.) Application running on port 5000 can be easily accessible directly from public internet. 
4.) Serverside encryption and Logging is not enabled for S3 buckets
5.) IAM password policy - minimum length - Root account is not complaint 
6.) EC2 instance should be managed by AWS Systems Manager.



**Bonus** - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
--------------
# Set IAM policy to readonly.
# Enable MFA for root access.
# Have a stricter IAM password policy.
# Limit traffic on the Loadbalancer.
# Disable unnecessary port access to the EC2 instance.
# Enable logging for S3 buckets.
# Traffic should only be allowed from security groups.
